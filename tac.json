Weil rigs can be thought of as coordinate algebras of spaces with a single point. In the category of additively idempotent rigs (2-rigs, for short) 2 is the initial algebra.\nWe characterize Weil 2-rigs as those that have a unique saturated prime ideal and provide an axiomatization thereof in geometric logic. We further prove that the category of Weil 2-rigs is a co-reflective full subcategory of the category of 2-rigs. Finally, we show that both the varieties of rigs, 2-rigs and integral rigs are generated by finite rigs with a unique homomorphism into 2.\n\n\n Keywords:\nExtensive categories, Rigs, Weil algebra\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n16Y60, 03C05\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 43, 2025,\nNo. 12, pp 382-402.\n\nPublished 2025-04-29.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/43/12/43-12.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

Raphael\n\n \n\nThis paper studies a category X with an endofunctor T : X \\to X.\nA T-algebra is given by a morphism Tx \\to x in X.  We examine the\nrelated questions of when T freely generates a triple (or monad) on\nX; when an object x in X freely generates a T-algebra; and when\nthe category of T-algebras has coequalizers and other colimits.  The\npaper defines a category of ``T-horns'' which effectively contains X\nas well as all T-algebras.  It is assume that  Xs  is cocomplete and\nhas a factorization system (E,M) satisfying reasonable properties.\nAn ordinal-indexed sequence of T-horns is then defined which provides\nsuccessive approximations to a free T-algebra generated by an object\nx in X, as well as approximations to coequalizers and other colimits\nfor the category of T-algebras.  Using the notions of an M-cone and a\nseparated T-horn it is shown that if X is M-well-powered, then the\nordinal sequence stabilizes at the desired free algebra or coequalizer or\nother colimit whenever they exist.  This paper is a successor to a\npaper written by the first author in 1970 that showed that T generates\na free triple when every x in X generates a free T-algebra.

However, this has almost exclusively been done using classical logic, whereas much of the utility of the pointfree approach lies in its constructive theory, which can be interpreted in many different toposes.\nJohnstone has advocated for the development of a constructive theory of uniform locales and wrote a short paper on the basic constructive theory via covering uniformities, but he never followed this up with a discussion of entourage uniformities or completions.\n\nWe present a more extensive constructive development of uniform locales, including both entourage and covering approaches, their equivalence, completions and some applications to metric locales and localic algebra.\n\nSome aspects of our presentation might also be of interest even to classically minded pointfree topologists. These include the definition and manipulation of entourage uniformities using the internal logic of the geometric hyperdoctrine of open sublocales and the emphasis on pre-uniform locales. The latter leads to a description of the completion as the uniform reflection of the pre-uniform locale of Cauchy filters and a new result concerning the completion of pre-uniform localic rings, which can be used to easily lift addition and multiplication on Q to R (or Q_p) in the pointfree setting.\n\n\n Keywords: \nuniform frame, metric frame, open locale, localic algebra\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n54E15, 06D22, 03F65, 54B30\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 41, 2024,\nNo. 8, pp 238-267.\n\nPublished 2024-03-27.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/41/8/41-08.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

These theorems for group-like algebraic structures (for example groups, rings without unity and vector spaces) can be obtained by choosing a Noetherian form based on lattices of subalgebras. In this paper we show that by replacing lattices of subalgebras with some other lattices, it becomes possible to move beyond group-like structures and encompass all types of algebraic structures (including sets, monoids, lattices). Moreover, we show that in a suitable sense, existence of a Noetherian form for a give type of mathematical structure is intimately linked with algebraicity of structures.

We establish an analogous result for enriched relative monads with dense roots, and explain how it generalises the nerve theorems for monads with arities and nervous monads. As an application, we derive sufficient conditions for the existence of algebraic colimits of relative monads. More generally, we establish such a characterisation of the category of algebras in the context of an exact virtual equipment. In doing so, we are led to study the relationship between a j-relative monad T and its associated loose-monad E(j,T), and consequently show that the opalgebra object and the algebra object for T may be constructed from certain double categorical limits and colimits associated to E(j,T).\n\n\n Keywords: \nRelative monad, relative adjunction, monadicity, virtual double category, virtual equipment, formal category theory, enriched category theory\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n18D70,18D65,18C15,18C20,18A40,18D60,18C10,18D20,18N10\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 43, 2025,\nNo. 13, pp 403-454.\n\nPublished 2025-05-11.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/43/13/43-13.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

This leads\n  naturally to a definition of \"inner automorphism\" applicable to\n  the objects of any category. Bergman and Hofstra-Parker-Scott have\n  computed these inner automorphisms for various structures including\n  k-algebras, monoids, lattices, unital rings, and\n  quandles-showing that, in each case, they are given by an obvious\n  notion of conjugation.\n  \n  \n\n  In this paper, we compute the inner automorphisms of groupoids,\n  showing that they are exactly the automorphisms induced by\n  conjugation by a bisection. The twist is that this result is\n  false in the category of groupoids and functors; to make\n  it true, we must instead work with the less familiar category of\n  groupoids and cofunctors in the sense of Higgins and\n  Mackenzie.

The affirmative answer we give relies crucially on working with not necessarily symmetric metrics. It applies not only to small separated and cocomplete categories enriched in the Boolean quantale 2 (reproducing Sup), or in the Lawvere quantale [0,∞] (producing the category we were looking for), but in any commutative and unital quantale V. Benefitting from previous work by Stubbe, Hofmann, and others, with rather explicit constructions of its tensor product and the internal hom we give an alternative proof that the resulting category V-Sup is *-autonomous, a result first established by Eklund, Gutiérrez García, Höhle, and Kortelainen in 2018 from a predominantly order-theoretic perspective.\n\n\n Keywords:\nsup-lattice, quantale, enriched category, cocomplete, *-autonomous category, dualizing object\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n16T05, 16E10, 18G20, 18A40\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 40, 2024,\nNo. 7, pp 227-248.\n\nPublished 2024-04-09.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/40/7/40-07.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

We showed that a small weak cofibration\ncategory induces in a natural way a model category structure on its\nind-category, provided the ind-category satisfies a certain two out of\nthree property. The main purpose of this paper is to give sufficient\nintrinsic conditions on a weak cofibration category for this two out\nof three property to hold. We consider an application to the category\nof compact metrizable spaces, and thus obtain a model structure on its\nind-category. This model structure is defined on a category that is\nclosely related to a category of topological spaces and has many\nconvenient formal properties. A more general application of these\nresults, to the (opposite) category of separable $C^*$-algebras,\nappears in a paper by the author, Michael Joachim and Snigdhayan\nMahanta.\n\n\n\n \nKeywords:  \nInd-categories, model categories, cofibration categories, simplicially\nenriched categories, compact Hausdorff spaces\n\n 2010 MSC:  \n55U35, 55P05, 55U10, 54B30, 18G55, 18B30, 18C35, 18D20\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 32, 2017,\nNo. 17, pp 620-651.\n\nPublished 2017-04-28.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/32/17/32-17.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n\n"

Walker\n\n\n\nGroupoidification is a form of categorification in which vector spaces\nare replaced by groupoids and linear operators are replaced by spans\nof groupoids.  We introduce this idea with a detailed exposition of\n`degroupoidification': a systematic process that turns groupoids and\nspans into vector spaces and linear operators.  Then we present three\napplications of groupoidification.  The first is to Feynman diagrams.\nThe Hilbert space for the quantum harmonic oscillator arises naturally\nfrom degroupoidifying the groupoid of finite sets and bijections.\nThis allows for a purely combinatorial interpretation of creation and\nannihilation operators, their commutation relations, field operators,\ntheir normal-ordered powers, and finally Feynman diagrams.  The second\napplication is to Hecke algebras.  We explain how to groupoidify the\nHecke algebra associated to a Dynkin diagram whenever the deformation\nparameter $q$ is a prime power.  We illustrate this with the simplest\nnontrivial example, coming from the $A_2$ Dynkin diagram.  In this\nexample we show that the solution of the Yang--Baxter equation built\ninto the $A_2$ Hecke algebra arises naturally from the axioms of\nprojective geometry applied to the projective plane over the finite\nfield $\\mathbb{F}_q$.  The third application is to Hall algebras.  We\nexplain how the standard construction of the Hall algebra from the\ncategory of $\\mathbb{F}_q$ representations of a simply-laced quiver\ncan be seen as an example of degroupoidification.  This in turn\nprovides a new way to categorify - or more precisely, groupoidify - the\npositive part of the quantum group associated to the quiver.\n\n\n \nKeywords:  \ncategorification, groupoid, Hecke algebra, Hall algebra,\nquantum theory\n\n \n2000 MSC:  \n17B37, 20C08, 20L05, 81R50, 81T18\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 24, 2010, \nNo. 18, pp 489-553.\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/24/18/24-18.dvi\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/24/18/24-18.ps\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/24/18/24-18.pdf\n\n       \t ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/24/18/24-18.dvi\n\n         ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/24/18/24-18.ps\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n\n"

Specializing to geometric inclusions, we characterize subtriposes of an arrow tripos in terms of nuclei on the underlying arrow algebra, recovering a classical locale-theoretic result.

This is equivalent to F being finitary for all\nfunctors between `reasonable' locally finitely presentable categories,\nprovided that F preserves monomorphisms. We also discuss the question\nwhen that last assumption can be dropped.

The problem of determining whether the same kind of phenomenon occurs when the property of being semi-abelian is replaced by the one of being action representable (in the sense of Borceux, Janelidze and Kelly) turns out to be rather subtle. In the present article we give a sufficient condition for this to be true: in fact we prove that the category Grpd(C) is a semi-abelian action representable algebraically coherent category with normalizers if and only if C is a semi-abelian action representable algebraically coherent category with normalizers. This result applies in particular to the categories of internal groupoids in the categories of groups, Lie algebras and cocommutative Hopf algebras, for instance.\n\n\n Keywords:\naction representable, semi-abelian, protomodular, groupoid, algebraic coherence, action accessible, normalizer, crossed modulesi, commutator\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n18E13\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 37, 2021,\nNo. 1, pp 1-13.\n\nPublished 2021-01-06.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/37/1/37-01.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

This project is rooted in M. Eisermann's work on quandle coverings, and the categorical perspective brought to the subject by V. Even, who characterizes coverings as those surjections which are central, relatively to trivial quandles. We extend this work by applying the techniques from higher categorical Galois theory, in the sense of G. Janelidze, and in particular we identify meaningful higher-dimensional centrality conditions defining our higher coverings of racks and quandles.\n  \n\n\n  In this first article (Part I), we revisit the foundations of the covering theory of interest, we extend it to the more general context of racks and mathematically describe how to navigate between racks and quandles. We explain the algebraic ingredients at play, and reinforce the homotopical and topological interpretations of these ingredients. In particular we study and insist on the crucial role of the left adjoint of the conjugation functor Conj between groups and racks (or quandles). We rename this functor Pth, and explain in which sense it sends a rack to its group of homotopy classes of paths. We characterize coverings and relative centrality using Pth, but also develop a more visual \"geometrical\" understanding of these conditions. We use alternative generalizable and visual proofs for the characterization of central extensions of racks and quandles. We complete the recovery of M. Eisermann's suitable constructions of weakly universal covers, and fundamental groupoids from a Galois-theoretic perspective. We sketch how to deduce M. Eisermann's detailed classification results from the fundamental theorem of categorical Galois theory.

Heuristically, we can think of a collection of morphisms which has a classifier and is closed under these operations as a well-behaved internal universe in the ∞-category under consideration. We will show that this intuition can in fact be made to a mathematically precise statement, by proving that, once fixed a Grothendieck universe, the existence of such internal universes in geometric ∞-toposes is equivalent to the existence of smaller Grothendieck universes inside the bigger one. Moreover, a perfectly analogous result can be shown if instead of geometric ∞-toposes our analysis relies on ordinary sheaf toposes, although with a slight change due to the impossibility of having true classifiers in the 1-dimensional setting.

In addition, our results give explicit constructions of\n c^I-images in\nfunctor categories using limits and c-images in the underlying category.\n In particular, they can be used to give explicit constructions of\nboth centralizers and normalizers in functor categories using limits and\n centralizers or normalizers (respectively) in the underlying category.\n\n\n Keywords: \ncover relation, image of cover relation, semi-abelian category, normalizer, centralizer, action accessible, functor category\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n18E13, 18A25, 18D99\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 38, 2022,\nNo. 10, pp 311-318.\n\nPublished 2022-02-02.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/38/10/38-10.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

We present its operational semantics as a stack machine, suggesting a\nterm judgement of stacks. We then see that CBPV, incorporating these stack\nterms, has a simple categorical semantics based on an adjunction between\nvalues and stacks.  There are no coherence requirements.\n\n  \nWe describe this semantics incrementally. First, we introduce locally indexed\ncategories and the opGrothendieck construction, and use these to give the\nbasic structure for interpreting the three judgements: values, stacks and\ncomputations. Then we look at the universal property required to interpret\neach type constructor. We define a model to be a strong adjunction with\ncountable coproducts, countable products and exponentials.\n\n  \nWe see a wide range of instances of this structure: we give examples for\ndivergence, storage, erratic choice, continuations, possible worlds and games\n(with or without a bracketing condition), in each case resolving the strong\nmonad from the literature into a strong adjunction.  And we give ways of\nconstructing models from other models. \n\n  \nFinally, we see that call-by-value and call-by-name are interpreted within\nthe Kleisli and co-Kleisli parts, respectively, of a call-by-push-value\nadjunction. \n\n\n Keywords:  \ncall-by-push-value, adjunction, CK-machine, monad,\ndenotational semantics, indexed category, continuations, possible worlds,\ngame semantics, call-by-name, call-by-value\n\n\n2000 MSC: \n18C50\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 14, 2005, \nNo. 5, pp 75-110.\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/14/5/14-05.dvi\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/14/5/14-05.ps\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/14/5/14-05.pdf\n\n         ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/14/5/14-05.dvi\n\n         ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/14/5/14-05.ps\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n\n"

There is a 2-category 2Vect having these 2-vector spaces\nas objects, `linear functors' as morphisms and `linear natural\ntransformations' as 2-morphisms.  We define a `semistrict Lie\n2-algebra' to be a 2-vector space L equipped with a skew-symmetric\nbilinear functor [ . , . ] : L x L -> L satisfying\nthe Jacobi identity up to a completely antisymmetric trilinear\nnatural transformation called the `Jacobiator', which in turn must\nsatisfy a certain law of its own.  This law is closely related to\nthe Zamolodchikov tetrahedron equation, and indeed we prove that\nany semistrict Lie 2-algebra gives a solution of this equation,\njust as any Lie algebra gives a solution of the Yang--Baxter\nequation.  We construct a 2-category of semistrict Lie 2-algebras\nand prove that it is 2-equivalent to the 2-category of 2-term\nL_\\infty-algebras in the sense of Stasheff.

This classification allows us to construct for any\nfinite-dimensional Lie algebra g a canonical 1-parameter\nfamily of Lie 2-algebras g_h which reduces to g at\nh = 0.

The discussion of one-dimensional\ncohomology $H^{1}$ in a fairly general category E involves\npassing to the 2-category Cat(E) of categories E. \nIn particular, the coefficient\nobject is a category B in E and the torsors that $H^{1}$ \nclassifies\nare particular functors in E. We only impose conditions\non E that are satisfied also by Cat(E)\n and argue that $H^{1}$ for Cat(E) is a kind of $H^{2}$ for E, and so on\nrecursively. For us, it is too much to ask E to be a topos (or even\ninternally complete) since, even if E is, Cat(E) is not. With this\nmotivation, we are led to examine morphisms in E which act as internal\nfamilies and to internalize the comprehensive factorization of functors\ninto a final functor followed by a discrete fibration. We define B-torsors\nfor a category B in E and prove clutching and classification theorems.

Seely\n\n \nLinear bicategories are a generalization of ordinary bicategories in\nwhich there are two horizontal (1-cell) compositions corresponding to\nthe ``tensor'' and ``par'' of linear logic. Benabou's notion of a morphism\n(lax 2-functor) of bicategories  may be generalized to linear\nbicategories, where they are called linear functors.  Unfortunately, as\nfor the bicategorical case, it is not obvious how to organize linear\nfunctors smoothly into a higher dimensional structure. Not only do linear\nfunctors seem to lack the two compositions expected for a linear\nbicategory but, even worse, they inherit from the bicategorical level\nthe failure to combine well with the obvious notion of transformation.\nAs we shall see, there are also problems with lifting the notion of lax\ntransformation to the linear setting.\n\nOne possible resolution is to step up one dimension, taking morphisms as\nthe 0-cell level.  In the linear setting, this suggests making linear\nfunctors 0-cells, but what structure should sit above them?  Lax\ntransformations in a suitable sense just do not seem to work very well\nfor this purpose (Section \\ref{S:linnattran}).\nModules provide a more promising direction, but\nraise a number of technical issues concerning the composability of both\nthe modules and their transformations.  In general the required\ncomposites will not exist in either the linear bicategorical or ordinary\nbicategorical setting.  However, when these composites do exist modules\nbetween linear functors do combine to form a linear bicategory.   In\norder to better understand the conditions for the existence of\ncomposites, we have found it convenient, particularly in the linear\nsetting, to develop the theory of ``poly-bicategories''.  In this\nsetting we can develop the theory so as to extract the answers to these\nproblems not only for linear bicategories but also for ordinary\nbicategories.\n\nPoly-bicategories are 2-dimensional generalizations of Szabo's\npoly-categories, consisting of objects, 1-cells, and poly-2-cells.\nThe latter may have several 1-cells as input and as output and can\nbe composed by means of cutting along a single 1-cell.  While a\npoly-bicategory does not require that there be any compositions\nfor the 1-cells, such composites are determined (up to 1-cell isomorphism)\nby their universal properties.  We say a poly-bicategory is representable\nwhen there is a representing 1-cell for each of the two possible\n1-cell compositions geared towards the domains and codomains of the\npoly 2-cells.  In this case we recover the notion of a linear bicategory.\nThe poly notions of functors, modules and their transformations are\nintroduced as well.  The poly-functors between two given\npoly-bicategories P and P' together with poly-modules \nbetween\npoly-functors and their transformations form a new poly-bicategory\nprovided P is representable and closed in the sense that every \n1-cell\nhas both a left and a right adjoint (in the appropriate linear sense).\nFinally we revisit the notion of linear (or lax) natural\ntransformations, which can only be defined for representable\npoly-bicategories.  These in fact correspond to modules having special\nproperties.\n\n\n\n\nKeywords: Bicategories, polycategories, multicategories, modules,\nrepresentation theorems\n\n\n2000 MSC: 18D05, 03F52, 16D90\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories, Vol. 11, 2003, \nNo. 2, pp 15-74.\n\nhttp://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/11/2/11-02.dvi\n\nhttp://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/11/2/11-02.ps\n\nhttp://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/11/2/11-02.pdf\n\nftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/11/2/11-02.dvi\n\nftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/11/2/11-02.ps\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n\n"

This is\na question of some practical importance as much of the machinery of modern\ndifferential geometry is based on models which implicitly allow such a passage,\nand thus the results and tools of the area tend to freely assume access to this\nstructure.\n\n \n\nThe purpose of this paper is to make precise the connection between the two\ntypes of differential categories.  As a prelude to this, however, it is\nconvenient to have available a general theory which relates the behaviour of\n\"linear\" maps in Cartesian categories to the structure of Seely categories.  \nThe latter were developed to provide the categorical semantics for (fragments\nof) linear logic which use a \"storage\" modality.  The general theory of\nstorage, which underlies the results mentioned above, is developed in the\nopening sections of the paper and is then applied to the case of differential\ncategories.\n\n\n\n \nKeywords:  \nmonoidal categories, differential categories, Kleisli categories, differential \noperators\n\n 2010 MSC:  \n18D10,18C20,12H05,32W99\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 30, 2015, \nNo. 18, pp 620-686.\n\nPublished 2015-05-06.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/30/18/30-18.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n\n"

Seely\n\n \nThis paper revisits the authors' notion of a differential\ncategory from a different perspective.  A differential category is an\nadditive symmetric monoidal category with a comonad (a \"coalgebra\nmodality\") and a differential combinator. The morphisms of a\ndifferential category should be thought of as the linear maps; the\ndifferentiable or smooth maps would then be morphisms of the coKleisli\ncategory.  The purpose of the present paper is to directly axiomatize\ndifferentiable maps and thus to move the emphasis from the linear notion\nto structures resembling the coKleisli category. The result is a setting\nwith a more evident and intuitive relationship to the familiar notion of\ncalculus on smooth maps. Indeed a primary example is the category\nwhose objects are Euclidean spaces and whose morphisms are smooth maps.\n\n\nA Cartesian differential category is a Cartesian left additive\ncategory which possesses a Cartesian differential operator. The\ndifferential operator itself must satisfy a number of equations, which\nguarantee, in particular, that the differential of any map is `\"linear\"\nin a suitable sense.\n\n\n   We present an analysis of the basic properties of Cartesian\ndifferential categories.  We show that under modest and natural\nassumptions, the coKleisli category of a differential category is\nCartesian differential.  Finally we present a (sound and complete) term\ncalculus for these categories which allows their structure to be\nanalysed using essentially the same language one might use for\ntraditional multi-variable calculus.\n\n\n \nKeywords:  \nmonoidal categories, differential categories, Kleisli\ncategories, differential operators\n\n 2000 MSC:  \n18D10,18C20,12H05,32W99\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 22, 2009, \nNo. 23, pp 622-672.\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/22/23/22-23.dvi\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/22/23/22-23.ps\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/22/23/22-23.pdf\n\n\t ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/22/23/22-23.dvi\n\n         ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/22/23/22-23.ps\n\n         ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/22/23/22-23.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n\n"

The ubiquity of\nalgebraic structures in mathematics and related fields has given rise to\nseveral variants of universal algebra, such as theories of symmetric\noperads, non-symmetric operads, generalised operads, PROPs, PROs, and\nmonads. These variants of universal algebra are called {notions of\nalgebraic theory}. In this paper, we develop a unified framework for them.\nThe key observation is that each notion of algebraic theory can be\nidentified with a monoidal category, in such a way that algebraic theories\ncorrespond to monoid objects therein. To incorporate semantics, we\nintroduce a categorical structure called {metamodel}, which formalises a\ndefinition of models of algebraic theories. We also define morphisms\nbetween notions of algebraic theory, which are a monoidal version of\nprofunctors. Every strong monoidal functor gives rise to an adjoint pair\nof such morphisms, and provides a uniform method to establish isomorphisms\nbetween categories of models in different notions of algebraic theory.

More generally, we recover enriched Φ-adjoint functor theorems for weakly sound classes of weight Φ.\n\n Keywords:\nadjoint functor theorem, relative adjunction, lax-idempotent pseudomonad, KZ-doctrine, free cocompletion, pseudodistributive law, 2-category, formal category theory\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n18D70,18D65,18C15,18A35,18A40,18D20,18N10\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 41, 2024,\nNo. 20, pp 667-685.\n\nPublished 2024-06-05.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/41/20/41-20.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

We discuss the possibility of using certain\npresheaf toposes as generalizations of the Scott topology at this\nlevel. We show that the toposes associated with Scott complete\ncategories are injective with respect to dense inclusions of\ntoposes. We propose analogues of the upper and lower powerdomain\nin terms of the Scott topology at the level of categories. We show\nthat the class of finitely accessible categories is closed under\nthis generalized upper powerdomain construction (the respective\nresult about the lower powerdomain construction is essentially\nknown). We also treat the notion of ``coherent domain'' by\nintroducing two possible notions of coherence for a finitely\naccessible category (qua generalized domain). The one of them\nimitates the stability of the compact saturated sets under\nintersection and the other one imitates the so-called ``2/3 SFP''\nproperty. We show that the two notions are equivalent.

We show that any filtral pretopos satisfying some mild additional conditions can be embedded into the category of compact Hausdorff locales. This result is valid in the internal logic of any topos. Assuming the principle of weak excluded middle and the existence of copowers of the terminal object in the pretopos, the image of the embedding contains all spatial compact Hausdorff locales.\n\n\n\nThe notion of filtrality was introduced by V. Marra and L. Reggio (Theory Appl. Categ., 2020) to characterise the category of compact Hausdorff spaces within the class of pretoposes. Our results can be regarded as a constructive extension of the aforementioned characterisation, avoiding reference to points. If the ambient logic is classical, i.e. it satisfies excluded middle, and the prime ideal theorem for Boolean algebras holds, we obtain as a corollary the characterisation of compact Hausdorff spaces in op. cit.\n\n\n Keywords: \ncompact Hausdorff locales, pretopos, filtrality, constructive locale theory\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n18F70, 18B50, 03F60\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 41, 2024,\nNo. 41, pp 1439-1475.\n\nPublished 2024-10-10.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/41/41/41-41.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

In this paper, we establish criteria implying that an ∞-category --- for instance, a quasi-category, a complete Segal space, or a Segal category --- is complete and cocomplete, admitting limits and colimits indexed by any small simplicial set. Our strategy is to build (co)limits of diagrams indexed by a simplicial set inductively from (co)limits of restricted diagrams indexed by the pieces of its skeletal filtration. We show directly that the modules that express the universal properties of (co)limits of diagrams of these shapes are reconstructible as limits of the modules that express the universal properties of (co)limits of the restricted diagrams.

Here we introduce `structured cospans' as a way to study networks with inputs and outputs.   Given a functor L: A -> X, a structured cospan is a diagram in X of the form L(a) -> x <- L(b).   If A and X have finite colimits and L is a left adjoint, we obtain a symmetric monoidal category whose objects are those of A and whose morphisms are isomorphism classes of structured cospans.     This is a hypergraph category.   However, it arises from a more fundamental structure: a symmetric monoidal double category where the horizontal 1-cells are structured cospans.   We show how structured cospans solve certain problems in the closely related formalism of `decorated cospans', and explain how they work in some examples: electrical circuits, Petri nets, and\nchemical reaction networks.\n\n\n Keywords:\nbicategory, cospan, double category, monoidal category, network\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n18B10, 18M35, 18N10\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 35, 2020,\nNo. 48, pp 1771-1822.\n\nPublished 2020-10-29.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/35/48/35-48.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

It is clear that,\nand how, (E, M) can be recovered from such a P. The correspondence thus\ndescribed is actually the second of three similar ones between certain (E, M)\nand certain P that the article presents.

Lauda\n\n \n\nIn this paper we explain the relationship between Frobenius\nobjects in monoidal categories and adjunctions in 2-categories.\nSpecifically, we show that every Frobenius object in a monoidal\ncategory $M$ arises from an ambijunction (simultaneous left and\nright adjoints) in some 2-category $\\mathcal{D}$ into which $M$\nfully and faithfully embeds. Since a 2D topological quantum field\ntheory is equivalent to a commutative Frobenius algebra, this\nresult also shows that every 2D TQFT is obtained from an\nambijunction in some 2-category. Our theorem is proved by\nextending the theory of adjoint monads to the context of an\narbitrary 2-category and utilizing the free completion under\nEilenberg-Moore objects.  We then categorify this theorem by\nreplacing the monoidal category $M$ with a semistrict monoidal\n2-category $M$, and replacing the 2-category $\\mathcal{D}$ into\nwhich it embeds by a semistrict 3-category.  To state this more\npowerful result, we must first define the notion of a `Frobenius\npseudomonoid', which categorifies that of a Frobenius object. We\nthen define the notion of a `pseudo ambijunction', categorifying\nthat of an ambijunction. In each case, the idea is that all the\nusual axioms now hold only up to coherent isomorphism.  Finally,\nwe show that every Frobenius pseudomonoid in a semistrict monoidal\n2-category arises from a pseudo ambijunction in some semistrict\n3-category.\n\n\n Keywords:  \npseudoadjunction, pseudomonad, Frobenius pseudomonoid,\nEilenberg-Moore completion\n\n 2000 MSC:  \n18D05, 57R56, 18D35, 57Q20\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 16, 2006, \nNo. 4, pp 84-122.\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/16/4/16-04.dvi\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/16/4/16-04.ps\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/16/4/16-04.pdf\n\n         ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/16/4/16-04.dvi\n\n         ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/16/4/16-04.ps\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n\n"

Furthermore, we show that the exact category obtained by first taking the idempotent completion of an n-exangulated category (C,E,s), in the sense of Klapproth-Msapato-Shah, and then considering its category of extensions is equivalent to the exact category obtained by first passing to the extension category and then taking the idempotent completion. These two different approaches yield a pair of 2-functors each taking small n-exangulated categories to small idempotent complete exact categories.

It is proved that one can do directed homotopy on symmetric transverse sets in the following sense. A q-realization functor from symmetric transverse sets to flows is introduced using a q-cofibrant replacement functor of flows. By topologizing the cotransverse maps, the cotransverse topological cube is constructed. It can be regarded both as a cotransverse topological space and as a cotransverse Lawvere metric space.   A natural realization functor from symmetric transverse sets to flows is introduced using Raussen's notion of natural d-path extended to symmetric transverse sets thanks to their structure of Lawvere metric space. It is proved that these two realization functors are homotopy equivalent on cofibrant symmetric transverse sets by using the fact that the small category defining symmetric transverse sets is c-Reedy in Shulman's sense.

More specifically, we provide mutually compatible tools for hierarchical, sequential, and independent parallel composition.    In our framework, hierarchies of hybrid systems correspond to template-anchor pairs, which we model as spans of subdividing and embedding semiconjugacies.  Hierarchical composition of template-anchor pairs corresponds to the composition of spans via fiber product.  To model sequential composition, we introduce ``directed hybrid systems,'' each of which flows from an initial subsystem to a final subsystem in a Conley-theoretic sense.  Sequential composition of directed systems is given by a pushout of graph embeddings, rewriting the continuous dynamics of the overlapping subsystem to prioritize the second directed system. Independent parallel composition corresponds to a categorical product with respect to semiconjugacy.  To formalize the compatibility of these three types of composition, we construct a vertically cartesian double category of hybrid systems where the vertical morphisms are semiconjugacies, and the horizontal morphisms are directed hybrid systems.\n\n\n Keywords: \nhybrid dynamical system, semiconjugacy, double category\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n18B20\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 35, 2020,\nNo. 45, pp 1634-1682.\n\nPublished 2020-10-09.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/35/45/35-45.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

Normality forces an \nequivalence\nrelation on cells, a special case of which was seen before in the free adjoint\nconstruction. These constructions are the object part of 2-comonads which are\nshown to be oplax idempotent. The coalgebras for these comonads turn out to be\nLeinster's fc-multicategories, with representable identities in the \nsecond\ncase.\n\n\n Keywords:  \ndouble categories, oplax double categories, paths, localisation\n\n 2000 MSC:  \n18A40, 18C20, 18D05\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 16, 2006, \nNo. 18, pp 460-521.\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/16/18/16-18.dvi\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/16/18/16-18.ps\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/16/18/16-18.pdf\n\n\t ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/16/18/16-18.dvi\n\n         ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/16/18/16-18.ps\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n\n"

Every small category C has associated with it a\npresheaf of groups on C, called its isotropy group, which in\na sense solves the problem of making the assignment C |-> \nAut(C) functorial. Consequently, every category has a canonical\ncongruence that annihilates the isotropy; however, it turns out that the\nresulting quotient may itself have non-trivial isotropy. This\nphenomenon, which we term higher order isotropy, is the subject\nof our investigation. We show that with each category C we may\nassociate a sequence of groups called its higher isotropy groups, and\nthat these give rise to a sequence of quotients of C. This sequence\nleads us to an ordinal invariant for small categories, which we call\nisotropy rank: the isotropy rank of a small category is the\nordinal at which the sequence of quotients stabilizes. Our main results\nstate that each small category has a well-defined isotropy rank, and\nmoreover, that for each small ordinal one may construct a small category\nwith precisely that rank. It happens that isotropy rank of a small\ncategory is an instance of the same concept for Grothendieck toposes,\nfor which corresponding statements hold. Most of the technical work in\nthe paper is concerned with the development of tools that allow us to\ncompute (higher) isotropy groups of categories in terms of those of\ncertain suitable subcategories.\n\n\n \nKeywords:  \nutomorphism groups, algebraic invariants of categories, toposes\n\n 2010 MSC:  \n08A35, 18A23, 18A32, 18B25, 18D35\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 33, 2018,\nNo. 20, pp 537-582.\n\nPublished 2018-06-03.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/33/20/33-20.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n\n"

This paper studies a generalization of PCAs, introduced by W. Stekelenburg, where a PCA is not a set but an object in a given regular category. The corresponding class of categories of assemblies is closed both under taking small products and under slicing, which is to be contrasted with the situation for ordinary PCAs. We describe these two constructions explicitly at the level of PCAs, allowing us to compute a number of examples of products and slices of PCAs. Moreover, we show how PCAs can be transported along regular functors, enabling us to compare PCAs constructed over different base categories. Via a Grothendieck construction, this leads to a (2-)category whose objects are PCAs and whose arrows are generalized applicative morphisms. This category has small products, which correspond to the small products of categories of assemblies, and it has finite coproducts in a weak sense. Finally, we give a criterion when a functor between categories of assemblies that is induced by an applicative morphism has a right adjoint, by generalizing the notion of computational density.\n\n\n Keywords:\npartial combinatory algebra, assemblies, toposes, slicing\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n03G30, 68Q09, 18B25\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 35, 2020,\nNo. 52, pp 1907-1952.\n\nPublished 2020-12-04.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/35/52/35-52.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

For some types of spans we require the\nambient category to be adhesive to be able to form at least a weak\npullback in Span(C). The existence of all lax\npullback complements in C along a given morphism is equivalent\nto the exponentiability of that morphism. Since exponentiability is a\nrather restrictive property of a morphism, the paper first develops a\ncomprehensive framework of rules for individual lax pullback complement\ndiagrams, which resembles the set of pasting and cancellation rules for\npullback diagrams, including their behaviour under pullback.

We show how the\nproposed formalism can be used for constructing multiple sequence\nalignments with an emphasis on mutation mechanisms.\n\n\n\n \nKeywords:  \nMultiple sequence alignment, mutation mechanism, right Kan extension,\ncategory, limit sketch, pedigrad\n\n 2010 MSC:  \n18C99, 92B99\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 33, 2018,\nNo. 40, pp 1269-1317.\n\nPublished 2018-12-13.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/33/40/33-40.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n\n"

The definition of a Cartesian differential category is based on a differential combinator which directly formalizes the total derivative from multivariable calculus.  However, in the aforementioned  work the authors used techniques from Goodwillie's functor calculus to establish a linearization process from which they then derived a differential combinator.  This raised the question of what the precise relationship between linearization and having a differential combinator might be.  \n\n\n\nIn this paper, we introduce the notion of a linearizing combinator  which abstracts linearization in the abelian functor calculus.  We then use it to provide an alternative axiomatization of a Cartesian differential category.  Every Cartesian differential category comes equipped with a canonical linearizing combinator obtained by differentiation at zero.  Conversely, a differential combinator can be constructed à la BJORT when one has a system of partial linearizing combinators in each context.  Thus, while linearizing combinators do provide an alternative axiomatization of Cartesian differential categories, an explicit notion of partial linearization is required.  This is in contrast to the situation for differential combinators where partial differentiation is automatic in the presence of total differentiation.  The ability to form a system of partial linearizing combinators from a total linearizing combinator, while not being possible in general, is possible when the setting is Cartesian closed.\n\n\n Keywords: \nCartesian Differential Categories, Linearizing Combinators, Abelian Functor Calculus\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n18F40, 18F50\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 38, 2022,\nNo. 13, pp 374-431.\n\nPublished 2022-02-24.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/38/13/38-13.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

Our approach involves two\n  such monads, S and T, that are linked by a suitable\n  generalization of a distributive law in the sense of Beck.  This\n  takes the form of a span omega : TS <--> ST in the functor\n  category [X,X] and guarantees essential associativity for a\n  canonical pullback-induced composition of S-T-spans over X,\n  identifying them as the 1-cells of a bicategory, whose (internal)\n  monoids then qualify as ``omega-categories''.  In case that\n  S and T both are the free monoid monad on set, we construct\n  an omega utilizing an apparently new classical distributive law\n  linking the free semigroup monad with itself.  Our construction then\n  gives rise to so-called ``planar polycategories'', which nowadays\n  seem to be of more intrinsic interest than Szabo's original\n  polycategories.

Nevertheless, PAR does have a usual categorical product as well in the form\nA & B := A ⊔ B ⊔ (A × B). Surprisingly, asking that a distributive restriction category (a restriction category with restriction products × and coproducts ⊕) has A & B a categorical product is enough to imply that the category is a classical restriction category.  This is a restriction category which has joins and relative complements and,  thus, supports classical Boolean reasoning.  The first and main observation of the paper is that a distributive restriction category is classical if and only if A & B := A ⊕ B ⊕ (A ×  B) is a categorical product in which case we call & the \"classical\" product.\n\n\n\nIn fact, a distributive restriction category has a categorical product if and only if it is a classified restriction category.  This is in the sense that every map A → B factors uniquely through a total map A → B ⊕ 1, where 1 is the restriction terminal object. This implies the second significant observation of the paper, namely, that a distributive restriction category has a classical product if and only if it is the Kleisli category of the exception monad _ ⊕ 1 for an ordinary distributive category.\n\n\n\nThus having a classical product has a significant structural effect on a distributive restriction category.  In particular, the classical product not only provides an alternative axiomatization for being classical but also for being the Kleisli category of the exception monad on an ordinary distributive category.\n\n\n Keywords:\nRestriction Categories, Distributive Restriction Categories, Classical Restriction Categories, Classical Products, Classified Restriction Categories\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n18D99, 06D75, 06E75\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 42, 2024,\nNo. 6, pp 102-144.\n\nPublished 2024-07-22.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/42/6/42-06.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

While a\nsup lattice happens to have all infima, only the suprema are part of\nthe algebraic structure.\n\n \n\nExtending this idea, we look at posets that happen to have all\nsuprema (and therefore all infima), but we will only declare some of\nthem to be part of the algebraic structure (which we will call joins).\nWe find that a lot of the theory of complete distributivity for sup\nlattices can be extended to this context. There are a lot of natural\nexamples of completely join-distributive partial lattice complete\npartial orders, including for example, the lattice of all equivalence\nrelations on a set X, and the lattice of all subgroups of a group G. In\nboth cases we define the join operation as union. This is a partial\noperation, because for example, the union of subgroups of a group is\nnot necessarily a subgroup. However, sometimes it is, and keeping track\nof this can help with topics such as the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\n\n\n\nAnother motivation for the study of sup lattices is as a simplified\nmodel for the study of presheaf categories. The construction of\ndownsets is a form of the Yoneda embedding, and the study of downset\nlattices can be a useful guide for the study of presheaf\ncategories. In this context, partial lattices can be viewed as a\nsimplified model for the study of sheaf categories.\n\n\n\n\n \nKeywords:  \nPartial Sup Lattice, Complete Distributivity\n\n 2010 MSC:  \n18A25\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 30, 2015, \nNo. 9, pp 305-331.\n\nPublished 2015-03-18.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/30/9/30-09.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n\n"

We show that if the criterion is\nsatisfied and the groups Aut(n) are Noetherian, then Sh(A,Jₐₜ) is\nlocally finitely presentable. By applying this to the Malitz-Gregory\natomic topos, we obtain a negative answer to a question of Di Liberti\nand Rogers: Does every locally finitely presentable topos have enough\npoints?

In this paper, we study theories of\nsupercommutative algebras for which infinitely differentiable functions\ncan be evaluated on elements. Such a theory is called a super Fermat\ntheory. Any category of superspaces and smooth functions has an\nassociated such theory. This includes both real and complex\nsupermanifolds, as well as algebraic superschemes. In particular, there is\na super Fermat theory of $C^\\infty$-superalgebras.\n$C^\\infty$-superalgebras are the appropriate notion of supercommutative\nalgebras in the world of $C^\\infty$-rings, the latter being of central\nimportance both to synthetic differential geometry and to all existing\nmodels of derived smooth manifolds. A super Fermat theory is a natural\ngeneralization of the concept of a Fermat theory introduced by E. Dubuc\nand A. Kock. We show that any Fermat theory admits a canonical\nsuperization, however not every super Fermat theory arises in this\nway. For a fixed super Fermat theory, we go on to study a special\nsubcategory of algebras called near-point determined algebras, and derive\nmany of their algebraic properties.\n\n\n \nKeywords:  \n$C^\\infty$-ring, Lawvere theory, superalgebra, supergeometry\n\n 2010 MSC:  \nPrimary: 18C10, 58A03 ; Secondary: 58A50, 17A70\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 28, 2013, \nNo. 30, pp 1022-1098.\n\nPublished 2013-10-24.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/28/30/28-30.dvi\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/28/30/28-30.ps\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/28/30/28-30.pdf\n\n         ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/28/30/28-30.dvi\n\n         ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/28/30/28-30.ps\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n\n"

The first is to introduce a set of conditions on a class of arrows in a bicategory which is  weaker than the one given in [5] but still allows a bicalculus of fractions.  These conditions allow us to invert a smaller  collection of arrows so that in some cases we may obtain a bicategory of fractions with small hom-categories.   We adapt the construction of the bicategory of fractions to work with the weaker conditions.   The second issue is the difficulty in dealing with 2-cells, which are defined by equivalence classes.  We discuss conditions under which there are canonical representatives for 2-cells, and  how pasting of 2-cells can be simplified in the presence of certain pseudo pullbacks.

Bruguièeres and A. Virelizier study opmonoidal monads on\nmonoidal categories (which they called bimonads,). In a recent\njoint paper with S. Lack the same authors define the notion of a\npre-Hopf monad by requiring only a special form of the fusion\noperator to be invertible. In previous papers it was observed by the\npresent authors that bimonads yield a special case of an entwining of a\npair of functors (on arbitrary categories). The purpose of this note is to\nshow that in this setting the pre-Hopf monads are a special case of Galois\nentwinings. As a byproduct some new properties are detected which make a\n(general) bimonad on a Cauchy complete category to a Hopf monad. In the\nfinal section applications to cartesian monoidal categories are\nconsidered.\n\n\n \nKeywords:  \nOpmonoidal functors, bimonads, Hopf monads, Galois entwinings\n\n \n2000 MSC:  \n18A40, 16T15, 18C20\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 26, 2012, \nNo. 10, pp 281-303.\n\nPublished 2012-06-05.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/26/10/26-10.dvi\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/26/10/26-10.ps\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/26/10/26-10.pdf\n\n\t ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/26/10/26-10.dvi\n\n         ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/26/10/26-.10ps\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n\n"

Bergomi and Pietro Vertechi\n\n\n\n\n  Persistence has proved to be a valuable tool to analyze real world data robustly. Several approaches to persistence have been attempted over time, some topological in flavor, based on the vector space-valued homology functor, others combinatorial, based on arbitrary set-valued functors. To unify the study of topological and combinatorial persistence in a common categorical framework, we give axioms for a generalized rank function on objects in a target category so that functors to that category induce persistence functions. We port the interleaving and bottleneck distances to this novel framework and generalize classical equalities and inequalities. Unlike sets and vector spaces, in many categories the rank of an object does not identify it up to isomorphism: to preserve information about the structure of persistence modules, we define colorable ranks, persistence diagrams and prove the equality between multicolored bottleneck distance and interleaving distance in semisimple Abelian categories. To illustrate our framework in practice, we give examples of multicolored persistent homology on filtered topological spaces with a group action and labeled point cloud data.\n\n\n Keywords:\nrank, persistence, categorification, regular category, abelian category, semisimple category, classification, group action, point cloud, poset, bottleneck, interleaving\n\n\n2010 MSC:\n18E10, 18A35, 55N35, 68U05\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 35, 2020,\nNo. 9, pp 228-260.\n\nPublished 2020-02-24.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/35/9/35-09.pdf\n\n\nNote: when this article was originally published, the authors of the article and the handling editor were unaware of related work in this area.

Equivalently, a moment category is a category with an active/inert factorisation system fulfilling two simple axioms. These axioms imply that the moments of a fixed object form a monoid, actually a left regular band.\n\nEach locally finite unital moment category defines a specific type of operad which records the combinatorics of partitioning moments into elementary ones. In this way the notions of symmetric, non-symmetric and n-operad correspond to unital moment structures on Γ, Δ and Θ_n respectively.\n\nThere is an analog of the plus construction of Baez-Dolan taking a unital moment category C to a unital hypermoment category C^+. Under this construction, C-operads get identified with C^+-monoids, i.e. presheaves on C^+ satisfying strict Segal conditions. We show that the plus construction of Segal's category Γ embeds into the dendroidal category Ω of Moerdijk-Weiss.\n\n Keywords: \nMoment category; Operad; Active/inert factorisation system; Strict Segal condition; Plus construction; Monadicity\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n18A32, 18M60; 18M85, 18N70\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 38, 2022,\nNo. 39, pp 1485-1537.\n\nPublished 2022-12-14.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/38/39/38-39.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

Stefanou\n\n \n\nThe interleaving distance was originally defined in the field of\nTopological Data Analysis (TDA) by Chazal et al. as a metric on the\nclass of persistence modules parametrized over the real line. Bubenik et\nal. subsequently extended the definition to categories of functors on a\nposet, the objects in these categories being regarded as `generalized\npersistence modules'. These metrics typically depend on the choice of a\nlax semigroup of endomorphisms of the poset. The purpose of the present\npaper is to develop a more general framework for the notion of\ninterleaving distance using the theory of `actegories'. Specifically, we\nextend the notion of interleaving distance to arbitrary categories\nequipped with a flow, i.e. a lax monoidal action by the monoid\n$[0,\\infty)$. In this way, the class of objects in such a category\nacquires the structure of a Lawvere metric space. Functors that are\ncolax $[0,\\infty)$-equivariant yield maps that are 1-Lipschitz. This\nleads to concise proofs of various known stability results from TDA, by\nconsidering appropriate colax $[0,\\infty)$-equivariant functors. Along\nthe way, we show that several common metrics, including the Hausdorff\ndistance and the $L^\\infty$-norm, can be realized as interleaving\ndistances in this general perspective.\n\n\n\n \nKeywords:  \nTopological Data Analysis, Persistent Homology, Category Theory, Lawvere\nMetric Spaces\n\n 2010 MSC:  \n18C10, 18D05, 18D10, 18D20 and 55N10\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 33, 2018,\nNo. 21, pp 583-607.\n\nPublished 2018-06-05.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/33/21/33-21.pdf\n\n\nRevised 2018-06-28.

To extend to nondeterministic and stochastic\nautomata such a monadic formalism, it is suitable to resort to a notion\nricher than the one of monad, but equally basic: the notion of\ndistributive law between two monads. The notion of algebra on a monad\nis then generalized by the one of algebra for a distributive law. The\nnondeterministic and stochastic automata are precisely algebras for\ndistributive laws whose first monad is $T_M$. If the\nnondeterministic case involves a distributive law between $T_M$ and\nthe well-known power set monad, the stochastic case involves a\ndistributive law between $T_M$ (where, here, $M$ is a measurable\nmonoid) and the probability monad. This allows presentation of the\nstochastic automata as algebras for this distributive law.

One way to solve these problems is to formalise the diagrams and their semantics using hypergraph categories, with semantic interpretation a hypergraph functor, called the black box functor, between them.\n  Building on a previous method for constructing hypergraph categories and functors, known as decorated corelations, in this paper we construct a category of decorating data, and show that the decorated corelations method is itself functorial, with a universal property characterised by a left Kan extension. We then show that any hypergraph category can be presented in terms of decorating data, and hence argue that the category of decorating data is a good setting in which to construct any hypergraph functor. As an example, we give a new construction of Baez and Pollard's black box functor for reaction networks.\n\n\n Keywords: \ndecorated corelation, Frobenius monoid,\n  hypergraph category, black box functor, well-supported compact closed category\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n18M35, 18M30, 18B10\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 35, 2020,\nNo. 26, pp 979-1011.\n\nPublished 2020-06-17.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/35/26/35-26.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

Later, several authors have extended this construction to wider contexts, including the Gleason cover for an elementary topos introduced by Johnstone in 1980.\n\n\nWe investigate properties of the Gleason cover for not necessarily sober T_0 Alexandroff spaces, i. e. spaces determined by partially ordered sets. First, we introduce the notion of co-local homeomorphism for such spaces, and prove that for every finite T_0 topological space X there exists a unique irreducible co-local homeomorphism p: X' --> X from finite extremally disconnected space X' onto X. Next, we extend this approach to arbitrary Alexandroff topological spaces.

Finally, we define generalized representatives or models of homotopy limits and full homotopy pullbacks. The concept of model is a unifying approach that includes the homotopy pullback used by J.

When V satisfies the weaker requirement of local boundedness, the resulting framework is sufficiently general to apply to the Φ-accessible monads of Lack and Rosický and the J-ary monads of the first author, while even without local boundedness our framework captures in full generality the presentations of strongly finitary monads of Lack and Kelly as well as Wolff's presentations of V-categories by generators and relations.  Given any small subcategory of arities j : J -> C in an enriched category C, satisfying certain assumptions, we prove results on the existence of free J-ary monads, the monadicity of J-ary monads over J-signatures, and the existence of algebraic colimits of J-ary monads.  We study a notion of presentation for J-ary monads and show that every such presentation presents a J-ary monad. Certain of our results generalize earlier results of Kelly, Power, and Lack for finitary enriched monads in the locally finitely presentable setting, as well as analogous results of Kelly and Lack for strongly finitary monads on cartesian closed categories.

Motivated by the search for a geometrical framework for developing\ngauge theories in algebraic quantum field theory, we give, in the present paper, a first answer\nto this question. The notions of transition function, connection form and curvature form find a\nnice description in terms of cohomology, in general non-Abelian, of a poset with values in a\ngroup G. Interpreting a 1-cocycle as a principal bundle, a connection turns out to be a\n1-cochain associated in a suitable way with this 1-cocycle; the curvature of a connection\nturns out to be its 2-coboundary.

Such definition uses cartesian-marked lax limits, which are an alternative to weighted 2-limits. We show that a pointwise Kan extension along a discrete 2-opfibration is always a weak one as well.

Topol. 13:3 (2022), it was shown how a so-called orbifold datum A in a given modular fusion category (MFC) C produces a new MFC C(A). Examples of these associated MFCs include condensations, i.e. the categories of local modules of a separable commutative algebra B in C. In this paper we prove that the relation C~C(A) on MFCs is the same as Witt equivalence. This is achieved in part by providing one with an explicit construction for inverting condensations, i.e. finding an orbifold datum A in the category of local modules of B, whose associated MFC is equivalent to C. As a tool used in this construction we also explore what kinds of functors F:C->D between MFCs preserve orbifold data. It turns out that F need not necessarily be strong monoidal, but rather a `ribbon Frobenius' functor, which has weak monoidal and weak comonoidal structures, related by a Frobenius-like property.\n\n\n Keywords: \nmodular tensor categories, orbifold construction, topological quantum field theory\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n18M20,57K16\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 41, 2024,\nNo. 36, pp 1203-1292.\n\nPublished 2024-09-24.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/41/36/41-36.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

One approach, previously considered in [N20], requires the lax functor (-) x Y on D to have a right adjoint (-)^Y, for every object Y, while the other supposes that the exponentials are given by a lax bifunctor D^op x D --> D  also involving vertical (i.e., loose) morphisms of D. Examples include the double categories Cat, Pos, Top, Loc, and Quant, whose objects are small categories, posets, topological spaces, locales, and commutative quantales, respectively; as well as, the double categories  Span(D) and Q-Rel, whose vertical morphisms are spans in a category D with pullback and relations valued in a locale Q, respectively.\n\n\n Keywords: \ndouble categories, cartesian closed, spans/cospans, quantales, relations\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n18N10, 18D15, 18B10, 18F75, 54C35\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 40, 2024,\nNo. 3, pp 63-79.\n\nPublished 2024-03-26.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/40/3/40-03.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

The definition of the universal construction is given for various types of monoidal categories, including rigid and symmetric. It is also explained how to set up the universal construction for non-monoidal categories. The second part of the paper explains how to associate a rigid symmetric monoidal category to a small category, a sort of the Brauer envelope of a category. The universal construction for the Brauer envelopes generalizes some earlier work of the first two authors on automata, power series and topological theories. Finally, the theory of pseudocharacters (or pseudo-representations), which is an essential tool in modern number theory, is interpreted via one-dimensional topological theories and TQFTs with defects. The notion of a pseudocharacter is studied for the Brauer categories  and the lifting property to characters of semisimple representations is established in characteristic 0 for the Brauer categories with at most countably many objects.  \nThe paper contains a brief discussion of pseudo-holonomies, which are functions from loops in a manifold to real numbers similar to traces of the holonomies along loops of a connection on a vector bundle on the manifold.\nIt concludes with a classification of pseudocharacters (pseudo-TQFTs) and their  generating functions for the category of oriented two-dimensional cobordisms in the characteristic 0 case.\n\n\n Keywords: \nTopological theory, topological quantum field theory, TQFT, defects, universal construction,  pseudocharacter, pseudo-TQFT, Brauer envelope\n\n\n2020 MSC:\nPrimary: 57K16, 18M05, 18M30;\nSecondary: 15A15\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 44, 2025,\nNo. 2, pp 15-83.\n\nPublished 2025-01-08.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/44/2/44-02.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

More precisely, we prove that given a class E of morphisms in a small finitely complete category C, there exists a faithful conservative (respectively fully faithful) embedding C -> Set^D into a presheaf category which preserves and reflects finite limits and which sends morphisms in E, and only those, to componentwise surjections if and only if E contains the identities, is closed under composition, has the strong right cancellation property, is stable under pullbacks and does not contain any proper monomorphisms (respectively any morphism in it is a regular epimorphism). The classes of split epimorphisms and descent morphisms are such examples and the corresponding full embedding theorems are given by Yoneda and Barr's embeddings. As new examples, we get a conservative embedding theorem for the class of pullback-stable strong epimorphisms and a full embedding theorem for the class of effective descent morphisms.

While cells in a virtual double category classically have a horizontal multi-source and single horizontal target, the notion of augmented virtual double category introduced here extends the latter notion by including cells with empty horizontal target as well.\n Any augmented virtual double category comes with a built-in notion of \"locally small object\" and we describe advantages of using augmented virtual double categories as a setting for formal category rather than 2-categories, which are classically equipped with a notion of \"admissible object\" by means of a yoneda structure in the sense of Street and Walters. \n An object is locally small precisely if it admits a horizontal unit, and we show that the notions of augmented virtual double category and virtual double category coincide in the presence of all horizontal units. Without assuming the existence of horizontal units we show that most of the basic theory for virtual double categories, such as that of restriction and composition of horizontal morphisms, extends to augmented virtual double categories.

Namely, any symmetric strict monoidal 2-category M admits a\nsymmetric strict monoidal 2-category of pseudomonoids, monoidal 1-cells\nand monoidal 2-cells in M. Dually, there is a symmetric strict monoidal\n2-category of pseudomonoids, opmonoidal 1-cells and opmonoidal 2-cells in\nM. Extending a construction due to Aguiar and Mahajan for M = Cat, we may\napply the first construction p-times and the second one q-times (in any\norder). It yields a 2-category M_{pq}. A 0-cell therein is an object A of\nM together with p+q compatible pseudomonoid structures;  it is termed a\n(p+q)-oidal object in M. A monad in M_{pq} is called a (p,q)-oidal monad\nin M; it is a monad t on A in M together with p monoidal, and q\nopmonoidal structures in a compatible way.

It is\nwell known that any homological category in the sense of\nF. Borceux and D. Bourn is both normal and subtractive. We prove that in\nany subtractive normal category, the upper and lower $3\\times 3$ lemmas\nhold true, which generalizes a similar result for homological categories\ndue to D. Bourn (note that the middle $3\\times 3$ lemma holds true if and\nonly if the category is homological). The technique of proof is new: the\npointed subobject functor\n$\\mathcal{S}=\\mathrm{Sub}(-):\\mathbb{C}\\rightarrow\\mathbf{Set}_*$ turns\nout to have suitable preservation/reflection properties which allow us to\nreduce the proofs of these two diagram lemmas to the standard\ndiagram-chasing arguments in $\\mathbf{Set}_*$ (alternatively, we could use\nthe more advanced embedding theorem for regular categories due to\nM.~Barr). The key property of $\\mathcal{S}$, which allows to obtain these\ndiagram lemmas, is the preservation of subtractive spans.\nSubtractivity of a span provides a weaker version of the rule of\nsubtraction --- one of the elementary rules for chasing \ndiagrams\nin abelian categories, in the sense of S. Mac Lane. A pointed regular\ncategory is subtractive if and only if every span in it is subtractive,\nand moreover, the functor $\\mathcal{S}$ not only preserves but also\nreflects subtractive spans. Thus, subtractivity seems to be exactly what\nwe need in order to prove the upper/lower $3\\times 3$ lemmas in a normal\ncategory. Indeed, we show that a normal category is subtractive if and\nonly if these $3\\times 3$ lemmas hold true in it. Moreover, we show that\nfor any pointed regular category $\\mathbb{C}$ (not necessarily a normal\none), we have: $\\mathbb{C}$ is subtractive if and only if the lower\n$3\\times 3$ lemma holds true in $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\n\n \nKeywords:  \nsubtractive category; normal category; homological category; homological\ndiagram lemmas; diagram chasing\n\n 2000 MSC:  \n18G50, 18C99\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 23, 2010, \nNo. 11, pp 221-242.\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/23/11/23-11.dvi\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/23/11/23-11.ps\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/23/11/23-11.pdf\n\n\t ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/23/11/23-11.dvi\n\n         ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/23/11/23-11.ps\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n\n"

In particular, we consider a category\nFinStat where an object is a finite set equipped with a probability\ndistribution, while a morphism is a measure-preserving function $f \\maps X\n\\to Y$ together with a stochastic right inverse $s \\maps Y \\to X$.

Given this data we can define the entropy of the\nprobability distribution on $X$ relative to the `prior' given by pushing\nthe probability distribution on $Y$ forwards along $s$.  We say that $s$\nis `optimal' if these distributions agree.  We show that any convex\nlinear, lower semicontinuous functor from FinStat to the additive\nmonoid $[0,\\infty]$ which vanishes when $s$ is optimal must be a scalar\nmultiple of this relative entropy.

Van der Linden\n\n \nThe aim of this paper is to describe Quillen model category structures\non the category CatC of internal categories and functors in a given\nfinitely complete category C. Several non-equivalent notions of\ninternal equivalence exist; to capture these notions, the model\nstructures are defined relative to a given Grothendieck topology on\nC.\n\nUnder mild conditions on C, the regular epimorphism topology\ndetermines a model structure where we is the class of weak\nequivalences of internal categories (in the sense of Bunge and Pare).\nFor a Grothendieck topos C we get a structure that, though different\nfrom Joyal and Tierney's, has an equivalent homotopy category. In case\nC is semi-abelian, these weak equivalences turn out to be homology\nisomorphisms, and the model structure on CatC induces a notion of\nhomotopy of internal crossed modules. In case C is the category\nGp of groups and homomorphisms, it reduces to the case of crossed\nmodules of groups.\n\nThe trivial topology on a category C determines a model structure on\nCatC where we is the class of strong equivalences (homotopy\nequivalences), fib the class of internal functors with the homotopy\nlifting property, and cof the class of functors with the homotopy\nextension property.

We describe a category where a\nmorphism is a circuit of this sort with marked input and output\nterminals.  In this category, composition describes the process of\nattaching the outputs of one circuit to the inputs of another.  We\nconstruct a functor, dubbed the `black box functor', that takes a\ncircuit, forgets its internal structure, and remembers only its external\nbehavior.  Two circuits have the same external behavior if and only if\nthey impose same relation between currents and potentials at their\nterminals.  The space of these currents and potentials naturally has the\nstructure of a symplectic vector space, and the relation imposed by a\ncircuit is a Lagrangian linear relation.  Thus, the black box functor\ngoes from our category of circuits to a category with Lagrangian linear\nrelations as morphisms.  We prove that this functor is symmetric\nmonoidal and indeed a hypergraph functor.

Finally, we give some examples where this correspondence appears, spanning from the fundamental and family fibrations to network models and systems.\n\n\n Keywords:\nFibrations, indexed categories, Grothendieck construction, monoidal 2-categories, monoidal pseudofunctors\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n18D30,18M05\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 35, 2020,\nNo. 31, pp 1159-1207.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/35/31/35-31.pdf\n\n\nRevised 2020-10-27.

Following the work of Lack, these\nuniversal objects must be constructed from simplicial objects arising\nfrom our monad-theoretic framework, as certain 2-categorical colimits\ncalled codescent objects.

These are the crossed internal categories of the title, and\ngeneralise the crossed simplicial groups of Loday and Fiedorowicz. The\nmost general results of this article are concerned with how to compute\nsuch codescent objects in 2-categories of internal categories, and on\nisolating conditions on the monad-theoretic situation which enable\nthese results to apply. Combined with earlier work of the author in\nwhich operads are seen as polynomial 2-monads, our results are then\napplied to the theory of non-symmetric, symmetric and braided operads.\nIn particular, the well-known construction of a PROP from an operad is\nrecovered, as an illustration of our techniques.\n\n\n \nKeywords:  \ninternal algebras, codescent objects, crossed internal categories\n\n 2010 MSC:  \n18A05; 18D20; 18D50; 55P48\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 30, 2015, \nNo. 50, pp 1713-1792.\n\nPublished 2015-12-02.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/30/50/30-50.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n\n"

The subject has been studied for about a century and has become an important area of mathematics. In recent years the area has been expanded to the noncommutative associative and Lie algebra contexts and to the case when the defining operator identity has a weight in order to include difference operators. This paper provides a cohomology theory for differential algebras of arbitrary weight, via a uniform approach to cover both the zero weight case which is similar to the earlier study of differential Lie algebras, and the non-zero weight case which poses challenges. The cohomology of a differential algebra is related to the Hochschild cohomology by a type of long exact sequence for relative homology. As an application, abelian extensions of a differential algebra are classified by the second cohomology group. Furthermore, formal deformations of a differential algebra are characterized by the second cohomology group and the rigidity of a differential algebra is characterized by the vanishing of the second cohomology group.\n\n\n Keywords: \ncohomology, extension, deformation, differential algebra, difference algebra, derivation\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n16E40,16S80,12H05,12H10,16W25,16S70\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 38, 2022,\nNo. 37, pp 1409-1433.\n\nPublished 2022-11-30.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/38/37/38-37.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

An alternative viewpoint is that it is a property of morphisms. This paper explores this point of view through a natural notion of extensive and coextensive morphism. Through these notions, topics in universal algebra, such as the strict refinement and Fraser-Horn properties, take a categorical form and thereby enjoy the benefits of categorical generalisation. On the other hand, the universal algebraic theory surrounding these topics leads to categorical results.

Various versions of this notion have\nalready been explored; our goal here is to provide a detailed\nintroduction to two, which we call `weak' and `coherent' 2-groups.\nA weak 2-group is a weak monoidal category in which every morphism\nhas an inverse and every object x has a `weak inverse': an\nobject y such that x \\tensor y \\iso 1 \\iso y \\tensor x.

Each information structure can be regarded as a ringed site with trivial topology; the structure ring is generated by the observables themselves and its multiplication corresponds to  joint measurement. We extend Baudot and Bennequin's definition of information cohomology to this setting, as a derived functor in the category of modules over the structure ring, and show explicitly that the bar construction gives a projective resolution in that category, recovering in this way the cochain complexes previously considered in the literature.

Such operads, and their algebras, can serve as tools for designing networks.

Any\nlax functor into Y factors through Y-mnd and the 1-cells turn\nout to be the familiar bimodules.  The locally ordered bicategory\nrel and its bicategory of monads both fail to be Cauchy-complete,\nbut have a well-known Cauchy-completion in common.  This prompts us\nto formulate a concept of Cauchy-completeness for bicategories that\nare not locally ordered and suggests a weakening of the notion of\nmonad.  For this purpose, we develop a calculus of general modules\nbetween unstructured endo-1-cells.  These behave well with respect \nto composition, but in general fail to have identities.  To overcome\nthis problem, we do not need to impose the full structure of a monad\non endo-1-cells.  We show that associative coequalizing\nmultiplications suffice and call the resulting structures   \ninterpolads.  Together with structure-preserving i-modules these\nform a bicategory Y-int that is indeed Cauchy-complete, in our\nsense, and contains the bicategory of monads as a not necessarily\nfull sub-bicategory.  Interpolads over rel are idempotent\nrelations, over the suspension of set they correspond to\ninterpolative semi-groups, and over spn they lead to a notion of\n``category without identities'' also known as ``taxonomy''.

Several authors have transported these ideas to a variety of settings, including contexts of category theory enriched in a symmetric monoidal closed category.  In this paper, we develop a general axiomatic framework for enriched structure-semantics adjunctions and monad-theory equivalences for subcategories of arities.

Furthermore, we employ our axiomatic framework to establish broad new classes of examples of enriched monad-theory equivalences\nand structure-semantics adjunctions for subcategories of arities enriched in locally bounded closed categories, including various convenient closed categories that are relevant in topology and analysis and need not be locally presentable.\n\n\n Keywords:\nLawvere theory, monad, enriched category, monoidal category, closed category, structure--semantics, subcategory of arities, relative adjunction, locally bounded category\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n18C10, 18C15, 18C20, 18C40, 18D15, 18D20\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 41, 2024,\nNo. 52, pp 1873-1918.\n\nPublished 2024-11-17.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/41/52/41-52.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

Drazin inverses can also be defined for endomorphisms in any category. However, beyond a paper by Puystjens and Robinson from 1987, there has been almost no further development of Drazin inverses in category theory. Here we provide a survey of the theory of Drazin inverses from a categorical perspective. We introduce Drazin categories, in which every endomorphism has a Drazin inverse, and provide various examples including the category of matrices over a field, the category of finite length modules over a ring, and finite set enriched categories. We also introduce the notion of expressive rank and prove that a category with expressive rank is Drazin. Moreover, we not only study Drazin inverses in mere categories, but also in additive categories and dagger categories. In an arbitrary category, we show how a Drazin inverse corresponds to an isomorphism in the idempotent splitting, as well as explain how Drazin inverses relate to Leinster's notion of eventual image duality. In additive categories, we consider core-nilpotent decompositions, image-kernel decompositions, and Fitting decompositions. We also develop the notion of Drazin inverses for pairs of opposing maps, generalizing the usual notion of Drazin inverse for endomorphisms. As an application of this new kind of Drazin inverse, for dagger categories, we provide a novel characterization of the Moore-Penrose inverse in terms of being a Drazin inverse of the pair of a map and its adjoint.  \n\n\n Keywords: \nDrazin Inverses\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n15A09, 18A05\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 43, 2025,\nNo. 14, pp 455-519.\n\nPublished 2025-05-28.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/43/14/43-14.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

Notably we formalise the classical notions of Kan extension, Yoneda embedding y:A→Â, exact square, total category and 'small' cocompletion; the latter in an appropriate sense. Throughout we compare our formalisations to their corresponding 2-categorical counterparts. Our approach has several advantages. For instance, the structure of augmented virtual double categories naturally allows us to isolate conditions that ensure small cocompleteness of formal presheaf objects Â.\n\nGiven a monoidal augmented virtual double category K with a Yoneda embedding y:I→Î for its monoidal unit I we prove that, for any unital object A in K that has a 'horizontal dual' A°, the Yoneda embedding y:A→Â exists if and only if the inner hom [A°, Î] exists. This result is a special case of a more general result that, given a functor F:K→L of augmented virtual double categories, allows a Yoneda embedding in L to be \"lifted\", along a pair of 'universal morphisms' in L, to a Yoneda embedding in K.\n\t\n\n Keywords: \nformal category theory, Kan extension, Yoneda embedding, Yoneda structure, exactness, totality, free cocompletion, augmented virtual double category\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n18D65, 18D70, 18N10\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 41, 2024,\nNo. 10, pp 288-413.\n\nPublished 2024-04-02.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/41/10/41-10.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

In\nthis paper we generalize the notion of a biproduct of objects in an\nabelian category to a noetherian form and apply it do develop\ncommutator theory in noetherian forms. In the case of semi-abelian\ncategories, biproducts give usual products of objects and our\ncommutators coincide with the so-called Huq commutators (which in the\ncase of groups are the usual commutators of subgroups). This paper thus\nshows that the structure of a noetherian form allows for a self-dual\napproach to products and commutators in semi-abelian categories,\nsimilarly as has been known for homomorphism theorems.\n\n\n\n Keywords: \nForms, product, commutators, Semi-abelian categories\n\n \n2010 MSC:  \n18D99, 18A30\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 34, 2019,\nNo. 30, pp 961-992.\n\nPublished 2019-10-03.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/34/30/34-30.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n\n"

In categorical algebra, such partial evaluations can be defined in terms of the 1-skeleton of the bar construction for algebras of a monad. We show that this partial evaluation relation can be seen as the relation internal to the category of algebras generated by relating a formal expression to its total evaluation. The relation is transitive for many monads which describe commonly encountered algebraic structures, and more generally for BC monads on Set (which are those monads for which the underlying functor and the multiplication are weakly cartesian). We find that this is not true for all monads: we describe a finitary monad on Set for which the partial evaluation relation on the terminal algebra is not transitive.\n\tWith the perspective of higher algebraic rewriting in mind, we then investigate the compositional structure of the bar construction in all dimensions.

In our previous paper, we constructed a closed model structure on the category of weakly unital dg categories, imposing a technical condition on the weakly unital dg categories, namely the idempotency $\\id_x\\cdot \\id_x=\\id_x$ for any object. Although this condition led us to a great simplification, it was redundant and had to be dropped. \n\n\t\t\t\tHere we get rid of this condition, and  provide a closed model structure in  full generality. The new closed model category is as well cofibrantly generated, and it is proven to be Quillen equivalent to the closed model category of (strictly unital) dg categories, given by Tabuada. Dropping the idempotency condition makes the construction of the closed model structure more distant from loc.cit., and requires new constructions. One of them is a pre-triangulated hull of a wu dg category, which in turn is shown to be a wu dg category as well. \n\n\t\t\t\tOne example of a weakly unital dg category which naturally appears is the bar-cobar resolution of a dg category. We supply this paper with a refinement of the classical bar-cobar resolution of a unital dg category which is strictly unital (appendix B).

Baez, Brandon Coya, Franciscus Rebro\n\n \n\nLong before the invention of Feynman diagrams, engineers were using\nsimilar diagrams to reason about electrical circuits and more general\nnetworks containing mechanical, hydraulic, thermodynamic and chemical\ncomponents.  We can formalize this reasoning using props: that is, strict\nsymmetric monoidal categories where the objects are natural numbers, with\nthe tensor product of objects given by addition.  In this approach, each\nkind of network corresponds to a prop, and each network of this kind is a\nmorphism in that prop.  A network with $m$ inputs and $n$ outputs is a\nmorphism from $m$ to $n$, putting networks together in series is\ncomposition, and setting them side by side is tensoring.  Here we work out\nthe details of this approach for various kinds of electrical circuits,\nstarting with circuits made solely of ideal perfectly conductive wires,\nthen circuits with passive linear components, and then circuits that also\nhave voltage and current sources.  Each kind of circuit corresponds to a\nmathematically natural prop.  We describe the `behavior' of these circuits\nusing morphisms between props.  In particular, we give a new construction\nof the black-boxing functor of Fong and the first author; unlike the\noriginal construction, this new one easily generalizes to circuits with\nnonlinear components.  We also use a morphism of props to clarify the\nrelation between circuit diagrams and the signal-flow diagrams in control\ntheory.

It is well-known that a variety of universal algebras is a Mal'tsev category if and only if its theory admits a Mal'tsev term. In the main theorem of this paper, we prove a syntactic characterization of the varieties that are weakly Mal'tsev categories. We apply our result to the variety of distributive lattices which was known to be a weakly Mal'tsev category before. By a result of Z. Janelidze and the third author, a finitely complete category is weakly Mal'tsev if and only if any internal strong reflexive relation is an equivalence relation.

In the present paper, we give a suitable counterpart notion\nto that of absolute admissible Galois structure for the lax idempotent context, compatible with\nthe context of lax orthogonal factorization systems. As part of this work, we study lax comma 2-categories,\ngiving analogue results to the basic properties of the usual comma categories. We  show that each morphism of a 2-category induces a 2-adjunction  between lax comma 2-categories and comma 2-categories, playing the role of the usual change-of-base functors. With these induced 2-adjunctions, we are able to show that each 2-adjunction induces 2-adjunctions between lax comma 2-categories and comma 2categories, which are our analogues of the usual lifting to the comma categories used in Janelidze's Galois theory. We give sufficient conditions under which these liftings are 2-premonadic and induce a lax idempotent 2-monad, which corresponds to our notion of 2-admissible 2-functor. In order to carry out this work, we analyse when a composition of\n2-adjunctions is a lax idempotent 2-monad, and when it is 2-premonadic. We give then examples of our 2-admissible 2-functors\n(and, in particular, simple 2-functors), especially using a result that says that all admissible (2-)functors in the\nclassical sense are also 2-admissible (and hence simple as well).\n\n\n Keywords:\nchange-of-base functor, comma object, Galois theory,\nKock-Zöberlein monads, semi-left exact functor,\nlax comma 2-categories, simple 2-adjunctions, 2-admissible 2-functor\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n18N10, 18N15, 18A05, 18A22, 18A40\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 40, 2024,\nNo. 6, pp 180-226.\n\nPublished 2024-04-05.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/40/6/40-06.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

Cofree Cartesian differential categories always exist over a specified base category, where the general construction is based on Faà di Bruno's formula. A natural question to ask is, when given an arbitrary Cartesian differential category, how can one check if it is cofree without knowing the base category? In this paper, we provide characterisations of cofree Cartesian differential categories without specifying a base category. The key to these characterisations is, surprisingly, maps whose derivatives are zero, which we call differential constants. One characterisation is in terms of the homsets being complete ultrametric spaces, where the ultrametric is induced by differential constants, which is similar to the metric for power series. Another characterisation is as algebras of a monad. In either characterisation, the base category is the category of differential constants. We also discuss other basic properties of cofree Cartesian differential categories, such as the linear maps, and explain how many well-known Cartesian differential categories (such as polynomial or smooth functions) are not cofree. \n\n\n Keywords: \nCartesian Differential Categories, Cofree Cartesian Differential Categories, Faà di Bruno Construction, Ultrametric, Differential Constants\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n18F40\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 44, 2025,\nNo. 25, pp 731-782.\n\nPublished 2025-08-13.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/44/25/44-25.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

The category of elementary doctrines provides a natural framework for studying algebraic theories, since each algebraic theory can be described by some syntactic doctrine and its models are homomorphisms from the syntactic doctrine into the doctrine of subsets. In this context, adding structure and axioms to a theory can be described by a homomorphism between the two corresponding syntactic doctrines, and the forgetful functor arises as precomposition with this last homomorphism. In this work, given any homomorphism of elementary doctrines, we prove the existence of a left adjoint of the functor induced by precomposition in the doctrine of subobjects of a Grothendieck topos.\n\n\n Keywords: \nelementary doctrines, free functors\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n03G30, 18A40, 18C10\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 41, 2024,\nNo. 15, pp 493-515.\n\nPublished 2024-05-07.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/41/15/41-15.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

This result together with a fibrant-cofibrant replacement is then used to obtain the 2-localization of a model category C at the weak equivalences W.

Furthermore, by building on\nJohnstone's notion of comprehension schemes for ordinary fibered categories, we characterize and relate numerous higher categorical\nproperties and structures such as left exactness, local cartesian closedness, univalent morphisms and internal (∞,1)-categories in\nterms of comprehension schemes.\n\n\n Keywords:\nComprehension, Relative Definability, Higher Category Theory, Fibered Category Theory, Univalent Mathematics\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n03G30, 18D30, 18N60, 18C50\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 43, 2025,\nNo. 6, pp 108-180.\n\nPublished 2025-03-09.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/43/6/43-06.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

Our main purpose in this paper is to generalize this\nconstruction without the local connectedness assumption. We replace\nconnected components by constructively complemented, or definable,\nmonomorphisms. Unlike the locally connected case, where the fundamental\ngroupoid is localic prodiscrete and its classifying topos is a Galois\ntopos, in the general case our version of the fundamental groupoid is a\nlocally discrete progroupoid and there is no intrinsic Galois theory in\nthe sense of Janelidze. We also discuss covering projections, locally\ntrivial, and branched coverings without local connectedness by analogy\nwith, but also necessarily departing from, the locally connected case.\nThroughout, we work abstractly in a setting given axiomatically by a\ncategory V of locally discrete locales that has as examples the\ncategories D of discrete locales, and Z of zero-dimensional\nlocales.  In this fashion we are led to give unified and often simpler\nproofs of old theorems in the locally connected case, as well as new ones\nwithout that assumption.\n\n\n\n \nKeywords:  \ntopos, fundamental progroupoid, spreads, zero dimensional\nlocales, covering projections\n\n 2000 MSC:  \n18B25, 57M12, 18C15, 06E15\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 20, 2008, \nNo. 9, pp 186-214.\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/20/9/20-09.dvi\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/20/9/20-09.ps\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/20/9/20-09.pdf\n\n         ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/20/9/20-09.dvi\n\n         ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/20/9/20-09.ps\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n\n"

We refer to this problem as the problem of existence\nof internalizations for decorated bicategories. Motivated by this we\nintroduce the condition of a double category being globularily generated.\nWe prove that the problem of existence of internalizations for a decorated\nbicategory admits a solution if and only if it admits a globularily\ngenerated solution, and we prove that the condition of a double category\nbeing globularily generated is precisely the condition of a solution to\nthe problem of existence of internalizations for a decorated bicategory\nbeing minimal in a sense which we will make precise. The study of the\ncondition of a double category being globularily generated will thus be\npivotal in our study of the problem of existence of internalizations.\n\n\n\n \nKeywords:\ncategories,double categories, bicateogries, von Neumann\nalgebras,cobordisms,algebras, bimodules\n\n 2010 MSC:  \n18B30,18D05,18F15\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 34, 2019,\nNo. 4, pp 80-108.\n\nPublished 2019-02-22.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/34/4/34-04.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n\n"

Wood\n\n \nThis paper studies lax higher dimensional structure over bicategories.\nThe general notion of a module between two morphisms of bicategories is\ndescribed. These modules together with their (multi-)2-cells, which we\ncall modulations, organize themselves into a multi-bicategory.  The\nusual notion of a module can be recovered from this general notion by\nsimply choosing the domain bicategory to be the terminal or final\nbicategory.\n\nThe composite of two such modules need not exist.  However, when the\ndomain bicategory is small and the codomain bicategory is locally\ncocomplete then the composite of any two modules does exist and has a\nsimple construction using the local colimits.  These modules and their\nmodulations then give rise to a bicategory.\n\nRecall that neither transformations nor optransformations (respectively\nlax natural transformations and oplax natural transformations) between\nmorphisms of bicategories give rise to a smooth 3-dimensional structure.\nHowever, there is a smooth 3-dimensional structure for modules, and\nboth transformations and optransformations give\nrise to associated modules.  Furthermore, the modulations between two\nmodules associated with transformations can then be described directly\nas a new sort of modification between the transformations.  This\nprovides a locally full and faithful homomorphism from transformations\nand modifications into the bicategory of modules.\n\nFinally, if each 1-cell component of a transformation is a left-adjoint\nthen the right-adjoints provide an optransformation.  In the module\nbicategory the module associated with this optransformation is\nright-adjoint to the module associated with the transformation.\nTherefore the inclusion of transformations whose 1-cells have left\nadjoints into the (multi-)bicategory of modules provides a source of\nproarrow equipment.\n\n\nKeywords: \nmodule, bicategory, transformation\n\n\n2000 MSC: \n18D05,16D90\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 11, 2003, \nNo. 17, pp 375-396.\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/11/17/11-17.dvi\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/11/17/11-17.ps\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/11/17/11-17.pdf\n\n         ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/11/17/11-17.dvi\n\n         ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/11/17/11-17.ps\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n\n"

From an operational\n  description of positions and moves in some game, called a\n  \\emph{signature}, we produce a pseudo double category, in which\n  objects are positions and vertical morphisms are plays.

Finally, cells may be thought of as embeddings of plays\n  preserving initial and final positions.

A striking feature of quantum theory is that those probability distributions obtained in quantum mechanical experiments do not always admit a joint probability distribution, a celebrated observation due to Bell. Such distributions are called contextual. Simplicial distributions are combinatorial models that extend presheaves of probability distributions by elevating sets of measurements and outcomes to spaces. Contextuality can be defined in this generalized setting.\nThis paper introduces the notion of convex categories to study simplicial distributions from a categorical perspective. Simplicial distributions can be given the structure of a convex monoid,   a convex category with a single object, when the outcome space has the structure of a group. We describe contextuality as a monoid-theoretic notion by introducing a weak version of invertibility for monoids. \nOur main result is that a simplicial distribution is noncontextual if and only if it is weakly invertible. Similarly, strong contextuality and contextual fraction can be characterized in terms of invertibility in monoids. Finally, we show that simplicial homotopy can be used to detect extremal simplicial distributions refining the earlier methods based on Čech cohomology and the cohomology of groups.\n\n\n Keywords: \nSimplicial sets, convexity, monads, contextuality\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n81P13,55U10,18C20\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 44, 2025,\nNo. 13, pp 372-409.\n\nPublished 2025-05-15.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/44/13/44-13.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

We adapt Meise's\ndefinition of smooth maps into a first model of Differential Linear\nLogic, made of k-reflexive spaces.

Cruttwell, Jonathan Gallagher, and Dorette Pronk\n\n\n\n\nThis paper describes the notion of a (latent) factorization system for a restriction category.  Analogous to factorization systems for ordinary categories, a description in terms of a Galois connection based on an orthogonality relation is given.  The orthogonality relation involving a unique cross-map (or lifting), however, is between a pair, consisting of a map together with a restriction idempotent, and a map.  This gives a significantly different character to the theory.\n\n\n\nA restriction category in which the idempotents split is precisely a partial map category whose partiality is given by the system of monics which split the restriction idempotents.  A restriction factorization on such a partial map category is completely characterized by a factorization on the total maps which is stable with respect to the system of monics; that is, pullbacks of both E and M-maps along these special monics are (respectively) E and M-maps.\n\n\n\nExamples of latent factorization systems are discussed.  In particular, one source of latent factorizations is provided by lifting latent factorizations from the base of a latent fibration into the total category: this is a generalization of the observation that one can lift a factorization from the base of an ordinary fibration into the total category.\n\n\n Keywords:\nRestriction categories, Factorization Systems\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n18B10, 18A32\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 42, 2024,\nNo. 7, pp 145-171.\n\nPublished 2024-07-22.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/42/7/42-07.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n"

This object is \nconstructed via (co)equalisers and images and equipped with a mapping class group action. It  can be viewed as a categorical generalisation of the ground state of  Kitaev's quantum double model or of a representation variety for a surface. We apply the construction to group objects in cartesian monoidal categories, in particular to simplicial groups as group objects in SSet and to crossed modules as group objects in Cat.

Gaunce Lewis, Jr.\n\n\nIf $\\cal M$ is both an abelian category and a symmetric monoidal closed\ncategory, then it is natural to ask whether projective objects in $\\cal M$\nare flat, and whether the tensor product of two projective objects is\nprojective.  In the most familiar such categories, the answer to these\nquestions is obviously yes.  However, the category $\\cal M_G$ of Mackey\nfunctors for a compact Lie group $G$ is a category of this type in which\nprojective objects need not be so well-behaved.  This category is of\ninterest since good equivariant cohomology theories are Mackey functor\nvalued.  The tensor product on $\\cal M_G$ is important in this context\nbecause of the role it plays in the not yet fully understood universal\ncoefficient and K\\\"{u}nneth formulae.  This role makes the relationship\nbetween projective objects and the tensor product especially critical.\nUnfortunately, if $G$ is, for example, $O(n)$, then projectives need not\nbe flat in $\\cal M_G$ and the tensor product of projective objects need\nnot be projective.  This misbe haviorcomplicates the search for full\nstrength equivariant universal coefficient and K\\\"{u}nneth formulae. \n\n\nThe primary purpose of this article is to investigate these questions\nabout the interaction of the tensor product with projective objects in  \nsymmetric monoidal abelian categories.  Our focus is on functor categories\nwhose monoidal structures arise in a fashion described by Day.\nConditions are given under which such a structure interacts appropriately \nwith projective objects.  Further, examples are given to show that, when\nthese conditions aren't met, this interaction can be quite bad.  These\nexamples were not fabricated to illustrate the abstract possibility of\nmisbehavior.  Rather, they are drawn from the literature.  In particular,\n$\\cal M_G$ is badly behaved not only for the groups $O(n)$, but also for the\ngroups $SO(n)$, $U(n)$, $SU(n)$, $Sp(n)$, and $ Spin(n)$.  Similar\nmisbehavior occurs in two categories of global Mackey functors which are  \nwidely used in the study of classifying spaces of finite groups.  Given \nthe extent of the homological misbehavior in Mackey functor categories   \ndescribed here, it is reasonable to expect that similar problems occur in\nother functor categories carrying symmetric monoidal closed structures\nprovided by Day's machinery.\n\n\r\nKeywords: closed category, symmetric monoidal category, Mackey functor, projective,\r\nflat, compact Lie group.\r\n\n\r\n1991 MSC: Primary: 18D10, 18D15, 18G05, 19A22, 55M35, 55N91,\r\n57S15; Secondary: 18E10, 55P91, 57S10.\r\n\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories, Vol. 5, 1999, No. 9, pp 202-250.\nhttp://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/1999/n9/n9.dvi\nhttp://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/1999/n9/n9.ps\nhttp://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/1999/n9/n9.pdf\nftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/1999/n9/n9.dvi\nftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/1999/n9/n9.ps\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n\n"

We will give a simple formula for this\nfunctor, which is based on a factorization, due to Duskin, of\nEilenberg and Mac Lane's classifying complex functor $\\overline{W}$.\nWe will give a new, short, proof of Kan's result that the unit\nmap for the adjunction $G\\dashv \\overline{W}$ is a weak homotopy\nequivalence for reduced simplicial sets.\n\n\n\n \nKeywords:  \nsimplicial loop group, d\\'{e}calage, Artin-Mazur total simplicial\nset\n\n 2010 MSC:  \n18G30, 55U10\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 26, 2012, \nNo. 28, pp 768-787.\n\nPublished 2012-12-13.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/26/28/26-28.dvi\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/26/28/26-28.ps\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/26/28/26-28.pdf\n\n\t ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/26/28/26-28.dvi\n\n         ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/26/28/26-28.ps\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n\n"

In many practical\ncases, the ordinary functor  $f : \\cal V \\to [cal \\A, \\cal A]$ underlying the\nmonoidal $F$ has a right adjoint $g$; and when this is so, $F$ itself\nhas a right adjoint $G$ as a monoidal functor - so that, passing to\nthe categories of monoids (also called ``algebras'') in $\\cal V$ and in\n$[\\cal A, \\cal A]$, we have an adjunction $Mon F$ left adjoint to  $Mon G$ \nbetween the\ncategory $Mon \\cal V$ of monoids in $\\cal V$ and the category \n$Mon [\\cal A, \\cal A] = Mnd \\cal A$ of monads on $\\cal A$.

In this paper we take C to be the category of (not-necessarily-unital) algebras over a (unital) commutative ring and consider central extensions with respect to the category of commutative algebras. We propose a new approach that avoids the intermediate notion of central extension due to A. Fröhlich in showing that $\\alpha:A\\to B$ is a central extension if and only if $aa'=a'a$ for all $a,a'\\in A$ with $\\alpha(a')=0$. This approach motivates introducing what we call weakly action representable categories, and we show that such categories are always action accessible.

Seal\n\n \nThe definition of a category of (T,V)-algebras, where V\nis a unital commutative quantale and T is a Set-monad, requires the\nexistence of a certain lax extension of T. In this article, we present\na general construction of such an extension. This leads to the formation\nof two categories of (T,V)-algebras: the category Alg(T,V) of\ncanonical (T,V)-algebras, and the category Alg(T',V) of\nop-canonical (T,V)-algebras. The usual topological-like \nexamples\nof categories of (T,V)-algebras (preordered sets, topological, metric\nand approach spaces) are obtained in this way, and the category of closure\nspaces appears as a category of canonical (P,V)-algebras, where P\nis the powerset monad. This unified presentation allows us to study how\nthese categories are related, and it is shown that under suitable\nhypotheses both Alg(T,V) and Alg(T',V) embed coreflectively into\nAlg(P,V).\n\n\n Keywords:  \nV-matrix, (T,V)-algebra, ordered set, metric space,\ntopological space, approach space, closure space, \ncloseness space,\ntopological category\n\n 2000 MSC:  \n18C20, 18B30, 54A05\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 14, 2005, \nNo. 10, pp 221-243.\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/14/10/14-10.dvi\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/14/10/14-10.ps\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/14/10/14-10.pdf\n\n         ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/14/10/14-10.dvi\n\n         ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/14/10/14-10.ps\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n\n"

We study actions of $G$ on objects $A$ of $\\mathbb C$ \n(defined by\nBourn and Janelidze as being algebras over a certain monad $\\mathbb T_G$),\nwith two objectives: investigating to which extent actions can be\ndescribed in terms of smaller data, called action cores; and to single out\nthose abstract action cores which extend to actions corresponding to\nsemi-direct products of $A$ and $G$ (in a non-exact setting, not every\naction does). This amounts to exhibiting a subcategory of the category of\nthe actions of $G$ on objects $A$ which is equivalent with the category of\npoints in $\\mathbb C$ over $G$, and to describing it in terms of action\ncores.  This notion and its study are based on a preliminary investigation\nof co-smash products, in which cross-effects of functors in a general\ncategorical context turn out to be a useful tool. The co-smash products\nalso allow us to define higher categorical commutators, different from the\nones of Huq, which are not generally expressible in terms of nested binary\nones. We use strict action cores to show that any normal subobject of an\nobject $E$ (i.e., the equivalence class of $0$ for some equivalence\nrelation on $E$ in $\\mathbb C$) admits a strict conjugation action of $E$.\nIf $\\mathbb C$ is semi-abelian, we show that for subobjects $X$, $Y$ of\nsome object $A$, $X$ is proper in the supremum of $X$ and $Y$ if and only\nif $X$ is stable under the restriction to $Y$ of the conjugation action of\n$A$ on itself. This also amounts to an alternative proof of Bourn and\nJanelidze's category equivalence between points over $G$ in $\\mathbb C$\nand actions of $G$ in the semi-abelian context.  Finally, we show that the\ntwo axioms of an algebra which characterize $G$-actions are equivalent\nwith three others ones, in terms of action cores. These axioms are\ncommutative squares involving only co-smash products. Two of them are\nassociativity type conditions which generalize the usual properties of an\naction of one group on another, while the third is kind of a higher\ncoherence condition which is a consequence of the other two in the\ncategory of groups, but probably not in general. As an application, we\ncharacterize abelian action cores, that is, action cores corresponding to\nBeck modules; here also the coherence condition follows from the others.\n\n\n \nKeywords:  \naction, semi-direct product, conjugation, normal subobject, ideal, \ncommutator,\nhomological category, semi-abelian category, algebra over monad\n\n \n2010 MSC:  \n18A05, 18A20, 18A22\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 27, 2013, \nNo. 15, pp 347-392.\n\nPublished 2013-03-13\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/27/15/27-15.dvi\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/27/15/27-15.ps\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/27/15/27-15.pdf\n\n\t ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/27/15/27-15.dvi\n\n         ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/27/15/27-15.ps\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n\n"

For example,\nthe geometric realization of a precubical set, a generalization of an\nunlabeled asynchronous transition system, admits a ``local preorder''\nencoding control flow. In the case where time does not loop, the ``locally\npreordered'' state space splits into causally distinct components. The set\nof such components often gives a computable invariant of machine behavior.\nIn the general case, no such meaningful partition could exist. However, as\nwe show in this note, the locally preordered geometric realization of a\nprecubical set admits a ``locally monotone'' covering from a state space\nin which time does not loop. Thus we hope to extend geometric techniques\nin static program analysis to looping processes.\n\n\n\n \nKeywords:  \npospace, covering space, directed topology\n\n 2000 MSC:  \n54E99, 54F05, 68N30, 68Q85\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 22, 2009, \nNo. 9, pp 252-268.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/22/9/22-09.pdf\n\n\n         ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/22/9/22-09.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n\n"

Most often, this condition is imposed on a copresheaf\nof the form B(X,T-) for a functor T: A -> B,\nin which case this property says that T admits generic factorizations\nat X, or equivalently that T is familial at X.\n\n\nHere we generalize these results to the two-dimensional setting, replacing\nA with an arbitrary bicategory A, and Set\nwith Cat. In this two-dimensional setting, simply asking\nthat a pseudofunctor A -> Cat be a coproduct\nof representables is often too strong of a condition. Instead, we\nwill only ask that F be a lax conical colimit of representables.\nThis in turn allows for the weaker notion of lax generic factorizations\n(and lax familial representability) for pseudofunctors of bicategories\nT: A -> B.\n\n\nWe also compare our lax familial pseudofunctors to Weber's familial\n2-functors, finding our description is more general (not requiring\na terminal object in A), though essentially equivalent\nwhen a terminal object does exist. Moreover, our description of lax\ngenerics allows for an equivalence between lax generic factorizations\nand lax familial representability.\n\n\nFinally, we characterize our lax familial pseudofunctors as right\nlax F-adjoints followed by locally discrete fibrations\nof bicategories, which in turn yields a simple definition of parametric\nright adjoint pseudofunctors.\n\n\n Keywords: \ngeneric factorizations, lax conical colimit of representables\n\n\n2020 MSC:\n18N10, 18D30\n\nTheory and Applications of Categories,\n Vol. 35, 2020,\nNo. 37, pp 1424-1475.\n\nPublished 2020-08-20.\n\n\n         http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/35/37/35-37.pdf\n\n\nTAC Home\n\n\n"
